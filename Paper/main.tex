Our solution for testing approximate programs for non-deterministic hardware is to rerun regular tests many times on emulated non-deterministic hardware. We propose comparing the test results with an estimate of how the known (because it was emulated) non-determinism should have affected the outputs. By detecting outliers (using Huber statistics or LMS detection) in the result distribution we can identify potential bugs.
